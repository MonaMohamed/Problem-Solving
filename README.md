#### 1 - Binary Simulation(https://lightoj.com/problem/binary-simulation)
Given a binary number, we are about to do some operations on the number. Two types of operations can be here:
I i j, inverts all the bits from i to j (inclusive).
Q i return whether the ith bit is 0 or 1.
The MSB (most significant bit) is the first bit (i.e. i=1). The binary number can contain leading zeroes.
